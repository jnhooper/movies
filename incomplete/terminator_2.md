I've commented on the tone already, but consider that this is a movie about a wisecracking kid making fun of a robot for how he talks

the very same robot previously shown wading through a sea of human skulls

and somehow it works

which is totally baffling

So it's brilliant because it's outrageously bad but still entertaining and watchable?

although I think the most interesting part of this movie is Sarah Connor  

and I never appreciated her character until the most recent watch

when I was a kid, and a moron (who can say if I've successfully cleared either condition), I was sort of annoyed by her inclusion  

because obviously I just wanted to see two robots fight each other

nowadays I find her to be easily the most interesting character in the movie

she's really the only one who appropriately understands the world she's in

a robot assassin from the future was sent back in time to murder her, along with a commando, who she fell in love with and was impregnated by before he was murdered by the robot

this commando tells her that her son would grow up to be mankind's only hope against an army of these robots

she barely escapes the robot, and then has to live the rest of her life with the simultaneous burdens of:
1. this knowledge of impending doom (which, I should mention, is never prevented as something that can be avoided, just something that must be endured in the best way)
2. everyone else in the world thinking she's crazy, despite incontrovertible (but disappeared) proof that she is right  

I know you already know all this, but I'm just restating it to frame the context in which you need to consider her mindset

I don't remember which character from Greek mythology was cursed with knowledge of the future, but that's what this is

he acts completely rationally for someone who knows the nuclear holocaust is coming, and all she gets in return is smug dismissal

she's trying to warn people that their greed and hubris will kill them all, and in return they mock and basically banish her  

James Cameron is saying this about us in general

the powers that be resist the uncomfortable truth that their actions are suicidal

because their vested interests / greed / denial / whathaveyou

and will deploy every lever of societal power against you

hence: why the T-1000, although he can transform into anything, reverts to the form of a cop

cops are frequent bad guys in this movie  

and the object of their oppression is this poor woman who only wants to have a normal life on a playground with her son

who can't because she has nightmares of annihilating fire

who probably has untreated PTSD from everything she went to

who lives in constant fear that, at any moment, another robot might be sent back through time to finish the job

and who can only watch helplessly while everyone around her goes about their death routines

and she still can't kill Miles Dyson

because to do so would be to totally submit to the fate that has defined her for over a decade

instead she chooses the humane option, which allows her to regain a little bit of herself, and ultimately (ignore the rest of the movies, they are trash) prevent Judgment Day
