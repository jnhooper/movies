The Two Towers is where the series really goes off the rails for me  

these movies are clearly made for people who have already read the books (or the wikipedia summaries of "The Silmarillion") and those viewers who have not (like me the first 1 or 2 times through) can be easily fatigued by the casual lore dumps

there's an awful lot of two characters, in that same whispered tone modern movies love to use in contrast the the ear-splitting battle volumes, saying something like "I am the servant of Oordthur, keeper of the flame of Anok, who now must take this Flizzord to Flargollen to stop Sargassus from attaining the  Mingleding"  

and then suddenly the Fellowship or some combination thereof must go to that place and do something, which usually involves a really cheap-looking fight scene with guys in Orc makeup that, despite their best efforts, still has that floppy foam-rubber look

with their purpose totally tied up in that mythology and politics that you were supposed to have figured out when Legolas casually mentioned it to Aragorn

CUT TO: Exterior, barren landscape

Sam or Frodo or both have fallen over a ledge into something dangerous

luckily they are saved at the last moment by _______

they reflect on their success by push-in close-ups where they try very hard not to kiss each other

and this cycle repeats basically through the third movie, with varying levels of characters going places and having cheap-looking and boring fight scenes

the first movie has its fair share of that

but since you're new to the world, you kind of expect to be a little lost

and moreover it rests on a foundation of relatability, with the Hobbits as these small town redneck idiots who live the closest thing to a life I can understand

and so I can also understand how overwhelmed they feel when they're cast into this world of incredible danger and powers beyond their understanding

the first movie also has Boromir, who acts most like a real person of any of the Fellowship

he's the only guy who says something like "Are you fucking kidding? You want to just waltz up to Mount Doom and toss the ring in?"

he is conflicted, obviously

in contrast to the other Fellowship members who are too pure of heart to even consider what they might do with a ring of power

what I'm trying to say is Boromir fucks

and yeah okay Aragorn is pulling dimes like nobody's business, but is there not a part of you that suspects that the furthest he ever got with Eowyn is an awkward hand job, or some Mormon soaking while Gimli jumped on the bed?

I just kind of don't care about him because he is too much a fantasy-novel character and not a real person

don't get me started with Legolas the asexual Ken-doll turned mass-murderer

and Gimli, after the first movie, is just comic relief

so the first movie has characters in positions I can relate to, after which they just run around doing fantasy stuff or grunting because the ring is evil, repeated for ~10 hours

I will say this: after having read the aforementioned wikipedia article, I am getting much more out of these movies

I can basically follow what's happening beyond the more superficial plot details, and the characters are no longer just babbling gibberish to each other
