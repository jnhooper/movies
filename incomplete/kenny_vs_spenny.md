I assume you’re all familiar with Kenny vs. Spenny?

if not, it’s free on Youtube and has some decent to brilliant comedy

the basis of the show is two best friends competing in challenges, the loser of which must perform a humiliation concocted by the winner

for those who are familiar, it seems, at first, that Kenny is a total sociopath and Spenny is naive, sincere-to-a-fault, and ultimately good-hearted

to the extent that the show is real and not staged, that is. But since there’s no way to tell for sure, let’s assume that it is real, or at least consider this a commentary on the characters they perform

so anyway, I always considered Kenny to be like almost pathological

he cheats constantly, he torments Spenny — with some really devious psychological torture

but there’s one episode that made me change my mind

I can’t remember which season/episode, but it’s a competition for who can sell the most bibles

Kenny decides that he will subvert the competition by hiring a talent agency to call Spenny about a script he submitted for a childrens’ movie

he convinces the agency to tell Spenny that a famous Hollywood actor has taken an interest in Spenny’s script and wants to have a table read

later, he pays a celebrity impersonator to call Spenny and pretend to be Robert DeNiro, the famous actor who was interested in the script

this works because Kenny knows that Spenny:
a) has submitted this script and believes in it and
b) dreams of being a Hollywood screenwriter

and he correctly (again, if this is real) intuits that Spenny’s lust for this reality will blind him to the possibility that it’s all a prank for the show

the agency calls, does the fake table read, makes Spenny an offer and tells him to fly to LA the following day

Spenny takes the bait, hook, line, and sinker

but the telling thing is what happens after he believes he’s been swept into success

I know from some interviews with the two that it is true that they moved to Hollywood together to try to make it as screenwriters, and failed. They were on their last dimes when a Canadian cable channel offered to make Kenny vs. Spenny, and it wasn’t exactly their first choice of career

and they are (or were, at least, before the show) best friends

who made student films together

all this to say that they have a history of shared struggle and presumably close friendship

but what does Spenny do when he gets the “offer” from Hollywood?

he immediately throws it in Kenny’s face

he starts gloating about how he’s successful, and Kenny’s a loser, and how he’s so happy that he won’t have to have Kenny dragging him down any more

in a few moments of sublime comedy, Kenny begs him to stay, or at least to help him get a few scripts in front of producers

and Spenny flat out abandons him

this is even funnier(?) because it would appear from the show that Kenny is far more talented than Spenny — at least as an entertainer on camera

and it occurs to me that, although Kenny is a dick, he never does anything to like, betray Spenny

he teases him constantly

but, if you’ve seen the show, it’s because Spenny is so easy to tease

Spenny is a perfect mark. He’s mentally weak, he exaggerates and overreacts to every provocation

he’s spiteful

it sounds like I’m victim blaming here, and I am, but he’s one of those people that reverse antagonizes bullies

by being such a little bitch about everything

even as an adult, there’s a kind of perverse pleasure in seeing him bullied because he’s so goddamn sensitive to everything

(this is one of the reasons the show is brilliant by the way: Kenny is a consummate bully, Spencer a consummate target)

he’s a 30-something year old man that shrieks hysterically whenever things aren’t going his way

but the thing is, I would argue that the same hysteria that shows in adversity is a sign of the moral weakness that would cause him to react so repugnantly to success  

he has no strong moral core (despite the fact that he is constantly moralizing)

as shown by the fact that all it takes is a spec script acceptance for him to totally abandon his best friend

Kenny, on the other hand, is always saying that Spencer is his best friend and that he loves him

and he definitely antagonizes him, but not in any way that lastingly damages

at the end of another episode, an obviously unstable Spenny cuts up all of Kenny’s clothes

Are you sure you're not just watching me through my webcam somehow?  No, but really I used to like the show a lot.  It felt less scripted back in the day though.

the end result of Kenny’s pranks are always harmless

haha @Kenneth Bitzer ofc I am

but also I think the YouTube algo is watching all of us, since these guys have a new show coming out

so it’s bumping Kenny’s channel

this is another point of evidence that the real bad guy is Spenny

since the show ended, neither have found much success

Kenny has found more, since he is the more talented of the two

but, so the story goes, Spenny was broke and desperate, and pleaded (who knows if that’s real) Kenny to do another show with him

and Kenny’s response (edited for trailers) was that of course he would because Spenny was his best friend and he loved him

despite the fact that I’ve heard that Spenny continues to hold some real grudges
