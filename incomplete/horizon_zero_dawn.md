as the unofficial video gaming channel, let me tell you a little about Horizon: Zero Dawn

I started playing it last night when a patch for Call of Duty on the PS4 would not install

this is more of a CoD petty complaint, but isn’t the console experience sold to people as plug-and-play?

the easy-mode for those who don’t want to fuck with PC settings?

because it is not

when the game decides to download its frequent patches, and install them, and then occasionally work, the matchmaking is bad, the netcode is bad  

everything is bad

so back to Horizon

this game is also bad

it’s a few years old so let me remind you of the selling points:
1) incredible graphics
2) immersive storyline and gameplay  

the graphics, while “good,” are not good

everything is lit bizarrely and the depth of field is very shallow

it’s the kind of thing I look at and think “wow, nice lighting,” while being completely unable to tell an enemy from some foliage in the background

the kind of game where you only know what to pick up and where to go because a big line overlay points to it and circles it

without that, I’d never find anything just by seeing it

the story is not interesting, or at least poorly told

it starts as this like hour long tutorial where you play as the main character but as a kid

clumsily stumbling through audio logs about the backstory

and painful sections where this older guy who is your dad (?) or your caretaker (?) forces you to do exactly what the game wants you to do or it resets the whole goddamn section

and the things it thinks you need to learn how to do are things like:
- walk while crouched
- pick things up with triangle
- press the crafting button

while sometimes encountering awkward cutscenes that also clumsily attempt to set up the context of the world

this wouldn’t be so bad, except that immediately after there’s a cutscene montage of him actually training you to be a warrior, and do things like kill the enemies you’ll soon meet

which you just have to watch and not play, which was very frustrating after so long just toddling around given tasks to check for signs of brain damage

then when it finally lets you into the world, it’s just the same game you’ve played a billion times

but somehow worse and more boring, because you can’t even see what’s happening

click on an enemy, you can see it’s exact patrol path

hide in long grass, where even though 35% of your body and your enormous bow is sticking out, no enemy can see you

then attempt to hit these extremely small weak points while this robot is flipping around like an acrobat

your only motivation to do any of it is that the main character that they were trying to build up your sympathy for wants to know about her past  

but I did not care about her

in fact I resented her, for making me be a stupid kid and learn how to climb up a ladder or whatever

and for just shouting expository dialogue at me instead of letting me just play through some atmospheric level design
