Once upon a time I tried to watch Stepbrothers and couldn't really get into it

so I tried again last night

and it's one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen

maybe not bizarre, but confusing

and I don't mean "confusing" like I didn't understand the plot

and I don't mean "bizarre" like the superficial put-on comedy premise of 40 year-olds that live at home and act like 12 year-olds

I mean it in the sense of: what am I supposed to be laughing at?

there's an essential question to the premise that is never really answered to satisfaction  

namely: what is wrong with these guys?

it's a movie you have to laugh at on a kind of meta level

we all know that John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell aren't actually emotionally damaged or mentally handicapped or whatever, and this film is just kind of a stage for these world-class goofs to act goofy

the kind of comedic situation perfect for extracting quips divorced of context -- which, as you all know, is exactly what happened  

("You wrecked my boat, you goons!")

("Space for activities")

etc.

so as long as what we're doing is just agreeing to watch our favorite actors do a slight variation on their usual comedy routines, it's passable and even pretty funny sometimes

but at any point that you allow any of the underlying narrative premise seep into your mind, it becomes very off-putting

like, what, are these guys actually mentally handicapped in some way?

what kind of accompanying trauma did the parents suffer to permit this kind of behavior?

and ultimately, what is to be done with people who just don't or can't fit into society?

one has to imagine that whatever disability prevented them from succeeding thus far is so encompassing and severe as to cripple them for the rest of their lives?

without extensive occupational / behavioral therapy?

and even then, what kind of future can they hope for?

there was one point where I had the thought that the only barrier between the humor and viciousness was the casting of the actors

to prove my point, imagine that instead of the two leads, someone who perhaps more closely physically resembles someone who has the mental state of these two characters was cast  

specifically: somebody who, by some by some fate of genetics was stricken with an insurmountable mental defect that stunted maturity  

like, for example, two actors with Downes Syndrome

if you imagine that, it's hard to also imagine laughing at the movie

all of these possibilities are circumvented at the end when, with no precedent, it turns out that these two are actually in fact fully capable of functioning in society and just weren't trying before

which might in fact raise even more questions

anyway, as long as you're willing and able to watch John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell act goofy and you're looking for some quips to throw around, it's a solid-enough comedy. 7/10

if at any point your eyes unfocus and you catch a glimpse into the abyss behind, it becomes very disturbing and uncomfortable. In which case, 7/10, neorealist masterpiece confronting the commodification of individuals in a capitalist system and the long-term consequences of early emotional trauma in families
