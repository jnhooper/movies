# Patrick Swayz-me

In this edition of: Nobody Cares What You Think About Movies, Matt. Please Stop Wasting Our Time,

it's a Patrick Swayze-thon!

All aboard the SS Dreamboat. Hubba hubba. And what better movie to helm this tour de force of sexuality than *Dirty Dancing*....

You may think this is a movie about people doing dirty dances. And it often is -- sometimes excessively and to its detriment. Perhaps to intentionally provoke but perhaps also because it was intended to be a low-budget, straight-to-VHS movie and they needed to fill time. But really, it's a piece of blatant, unmistakable, brilliant, leftist propaganda.

Of course it is. Obviously it is. Consider the premise: the elite gather in luxurious summer vacation to swap Yale stories and Yale letters of recommendation. This carousing occurs inside what is basically a castle, towering imperiously over the miniature fiefdoms of the guest houses. The working-class staff are housed in strictly segregated ramshackle cottages, allowed inside the walls of the castle only to perform. They live tenuous lives, exploited sexually and financially by the owners of the resort and the guests.

If you're still not convinced, consider that one of the villains (if there are indeed individual villains and not just a general context of callous apathy) attempts to hand her a copy of "The Fountainhead" when justifying why he need not assist his dancer girlfriend in obtaining a safe abortion. The political statement could only have been clearer had he handed her a copy of a Rush Limbaugh book. For a similarly obtuse example, Patrick Swayze's character admits openly to trauma from being used sexually by wealthy guests.

For more subtle (but still crystal clear) examples of this film's ideology, the constant discussion of wage insecurity in the face of the blinding wealth of the upper classes. The risk of death when attempting to find, and afford, an abortion in the absence of legal abortion or socialized medicine.

Not subtle. But like so many masterpieces, the rub is not in the story but in the telling. In this case, I think one must pay particular attention to whom, exactly, it's being told, and what, to them, it is trying to say.

Our main character, Baby (Francis), begins the story as a primal Lib, ensconced in all the ineffectual signifiers of social justice -- The Peace Corps, law school, economics degree -- and none of the signified. One instantly realizes that her current path ushers her comfortably, atop a palanquin of privilege, through the valleys of misery to an eventual seat beside the same vacationers at the same tables. It is her arc away from this delusion and into knowledge of the true plight of those beneath her social station which is the center of the film.

How does that arc end? First, consider how the film ends, when our banished hero Patrick Swayze defiantly returns to dance *his* style of dancing to shame the old fuddy-duddies. His style of dancing *is* the counter-culture, it is the future of the world, come to sweep away the sclerotic status quo! It is, in fact, announced by the owner of the hotel lamenting that "it feels like all this is going away."

And then what happens? In basically National Lampoon's fashion, the barons and heiresses LOVE the new dance! They begin dancing to it ecstatically. You see? You see? No revolution necessary. No inherent evil corrupted to the bone. All of these ghouls needed only be shown the light, unsuppressed by the true villains, to come to their senses, to be converted, to bring the dawn of a new era. Baby's father gives Swayze the nod of approval. The summer retreat will surely have dirty dancing lessons next season. Welcome, misfits, to the bounty of American Prosperity!

Why does this scene stick in the throat (besides the absurd brilliance of the line about "...baby in the corner")? Why does this scene feel so extremely tonally discordant with the somber lamentation of the rest of the film? For a movie so contemptuous towards the ghouls of the upper classes, their sudden conversion to the counter-culture feels like an abdication. In other movies like this, the hero would die or be killed in some kind of tragic incident made inevitable by his unfortunate circumstance. An image of a high-speed car/motorcyle crash comes to mind, although I can't be sure if this is a memory or a fantasy pastiche from the accumulated motifs of American cinema.

HOWEVER, this scene is the most brilliant in the movie and what makes it amazing propaganda. 

Art is a manipulation; an emotional product. In other words, what we get from art is only what it makes us feel. And like all emotional manipulations, we gravitate towards those that confirm our underlying biases. If you already believe that the elite exploit the working class for their labor, when you watch a movie about the exploitation of the working class, you become angry -- but not in any transformative way. You feel anger, but not unease. In fact, you probably feel more sure of everything than you did before. You have confirmed both that you are right and that there are good people out there that agree with you (even if they are only artists). Surely that must lead to something good?

But it doesn't. That affirmation leads to nothing but self-satisfaction and the perpetuation of the same world as existed before. To see the heroes triumph in such a nakedly sincere way would act like a release vavle for all the animosity you felt for the antagonists and their counterparts in reality.

You could end the movie with the exploitation continue unabated. But what would that observe? What insight would that provide besides artless despair? That's easy enough to disregard as overly cynical; the kind of unalloyed bummer reserved for documentaries.

Better to encapsulate a more profound truth in the filmmaking. Switch the style suddenly and without warning to provoke a bit of unease. To suggest what about the social struggle and counter-culture's role in it? The more sinister truth: that the powers that be don't fight culture, they consume it. They integrate it, appropriate it, and sell it back to you. Look at every brand during the pandemic supporting "our frontline heroes." Look at Pepsi BLM commercials. Look at the absolute rape and corporate enslavement of 60s symbols in everything from t-shirts to music to film.

That resort won't be destroyed by the outburst of new ideas (even the weasle-y little son-of-the-owner starts dancing to it), it will exist exactly as it did before with a new set of classes offered next season. The uneasiness you feel when attempting to digest this scene is its gift to you.

The propaganda is thate is makes you feel uneasy in the apparent victory of the protagonists. It makes you doubt, as if you got something wrong. And the thing that you got wrong was your satisfaction in imagining the good guys won just because you saw it in a movie.
